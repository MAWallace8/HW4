The intention of this project is to import two .csv files provided to us and merge them using pandas and csv packages.

The data is then sorted to produce 3 pie charts comparing fares by the type of city, driver by the type of city and amount of rides by type of city using the functions of the imported packages.

Finally, a scatter plot is produced that blends the information from all the data provided.  

From these visualizations, it is clear that urban type cities provide the highest amount of rides at the lowest fare prices.  Suburban type cities produce moderate amount of fares at moderate prices.  Lastly, rural type cities produce the least amount of rides at the highest fares.  There are some noticable outliers among the set of rural data provided, but there is a clear trend that is prominent in the scatter plot visualization produced.
